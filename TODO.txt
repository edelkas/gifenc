- Allow to work in 2 modes: palette mode and canvas mode. Palette mode you work
  with the color indices directly (with helpers), and canvas mode you work with
  the colors and then eventually the palette needs to be created based on those
  colors (either by finding the best possible palette, or by fitting the image
  in whatever palette was specified, perhaps with a given tolerance).
- When modifying the color table, we should probably have a flag that enables a
  trigger to update the canvas with the new color indices, to maintain the image,
  if that's what's desired (we may've changed the palette deliberately to
  change the theme of the GIF of swap colors, for instance)
- Add a hash map for the colors of a color table, for the sake of performance,
  which we update every time we modify the palette, or whenever we call a certain
  "update" method. In fact, let the user choose between these 2 policies. Moreover,
  have a member of the ColorTable class, "auto_update", that is true by default,
  that updates this inverted hash after every modification.
- Methods to modify the palette: darken, lighten (in fact, interpolate with respect
  to any color), grayscale, quantization, color shifting, etc.
- Implement interlacing
- Drawing: General lines (diagonal, width > 1, anchor points...)
- In the bound checks for line/rect we're not taking the width into consideration
- Enforce that we either have a GCT or every frame has an LCT, or at least, have
  a warning when that is done, and a hard switch that is needed to enable not having
  any tables, for those that really know what they're doing (mention this in the
  docs)
- Should we send indices or colors to Image.get, Image.set, Image.[], Image.[]= ???
- What happens when an image is placed at least partially out of bounds with respect
  to the logical screen? Does it get cropped, is the GIF corrupt? Perhaps we should
  either raise an exception here or crop the image, or let the user choose between
  these two policies.
- What happens if some frames have GCE and some don't?
- Should the transparency index appear when the transparency bit is not set?
- Add Rake tests
- Add exception handling to most functions
- Add logging (log, warn, err, lex...)
- The depth parameter has to do with the GIF, not with the color table, move it
  and adapt the docs and everything else
- If the GIF has multiple images but no GCE, decoders appear to animate them
  by default with the default delay of 10
- Decoder: When we finish parsing a block, and we stumble upon a byte that we
  dont' recognize (it's not the label of any recognizable block), keep parsing
  until we find one that we do, and try to continue from there. If it fails,
  consider that padding and give out warning.
