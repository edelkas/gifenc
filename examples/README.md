|Description|GIF|
|---|:---:|
|**first.rb** <br>First example from the main readme. Here we test some of the basic features of the GIF format, including animation, transparency, disposal method, etc.|![First example GIF](../res/first_a.gif)|
|**clock.rb** <br>Several methods from the `Geometry` module are used here to perform auxiliary calculations. We also test some more drawing primitives, such as lines.|![Clock GIF](../res/clock.gif)|
|**anchor.rb** <br>Experimenting with different `anchoring` settings for a rectangle's border. This controls whether the border is drawn inside the rectangle's boundary, outside it, centered, or any inbetween. The default is inside.|![Anchor GIF](../res/anchor.gif)|
|**circles.rb** <br>Experimenting with different `style` settings for a circle's border. This controls whether the border is drawn either as concentric circles (`:smooth`, bottom right) or by subsequently adding grid layers around the inner border (`:grid`, top left). The default is `:smooth`.|![Circles GIF](../res/circles.gif)|
