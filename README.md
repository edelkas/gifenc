# gifenc

A pure Ruby library that allows to encode and decode GIFs, with the aim to eventually implement the full GIF [specification](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt).

## Resources:
The following are a few of the excellent resources one can find on the net to get a deep understanding of the GIF file format.
- [What's in a GIF](http://www.matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/]): Comprehensive description of the GIF file format, LZW compression, and other related aspects. Illustrated with diagrams and examples. Includes online tools to explore GIF contents.
- [Manipulating GIF Color Tables](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1042433/Manipulating-GIF-Color-Tables): Detailed breakdown of the format, including a very nice diagram. Develops an open source GIF manipulation tool in C#.
- [Inside the GIF file format](https://web.archive.org/web/20230315204422/https://commandlinefanatic.com/cgi-bin/showarticle.cgi?article=art011]). Step by step explanation of a GIF decoder in C (has a similar article on [LZW compression](https://web.archive.org/web/20230315204422/http://commandlinefanatic.com/cgi-bin/showarticle.cgi?article=art010)).
- [Wikipedia GIF article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF): History of the format, break down of its structure, and other related interesting topics.
- [GIF specification](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt): And of course, the original GIF specification, which details every field of every block.
