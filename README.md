# gifenc

A pure Ruby library with no external dependencies that allows to encode, decode and edit GIFs. Its main goals are to:

* Support the full GIF [specification](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt) for both encoding and decoding.
* Have a decent suite of editing functionalities, so that the need for external tools is eluded as much as possible.
* Have a succint and comfortable syntax to use.

Currently, the specs are almost fully supported for encoding. Decoding is not yet available, and the editing methods are very limited.

## A first example

Consider the following GIF and the variation next to it. They already showcase most of the main elements of the format, including global and local color tables, transparency, animation, and different disposal methods. It also makes use of some basic drawing methods:

</p>

The code to generate the first version with `Gifenc` is the following:

```ruby
require 'gifenc'

# Build a couple color tables
reds = Gifenc::ColorTable.new(64.times.map{ |c| 4 * c << 16 | 0x40 } + [0])
greens = Gifenc::ColorTable.new(4.times.map{ |c| 64 * c << 8 | 0x40 })

# Paint a first frame that will act as a background, using a local color table
gif = Gifenc::Gif.new(128, 128, gct: reds, loops: -1)
gif.images << Gifenc::Image.new(128, 128, lct: greens, color: 0, delay: 2, trans_color: 0)
(1 ... 4).each do |z|
  gif.images.last.rect(16 * z, 16 * z, 128 - 32 * z, 128 - 32 * z, z, z)
end

# Add animation frames drawing a gradient, using the global color table
(0 ... 8).each do |y|
  (0 ... 8).each do |x|
    gif.images << Gifenc::Image.new(
      14, 14, 16 * x + 1, 16 * y + 1, color: 8 * y + x, delay: 5, trans_color: 64
    ).rect(4, 4, 6, 6, 64, 64)
  end
end

# Export the GIF to a file
gif.save('test.gif')
```

Let's see a step-by-step overview, see the following sections for an in-depth explanation of the actual details for each of the topics involved.
1. The first thing we do is create two **Color Tables**, one with red shades, and another with green shades. Since GIF is an indexed image format, it can only use colors on these predefined palettes of at most 256 colors. `Gifenc` comes equipped with several default ones, but you can build your own, and operate with them.
2. We create the GIF object. We select the red color table to be the **GCT** (_Global Color Table_), which is used for all frames that do not contain an explicit **LCT** (_Local Color Table_). We also set the GIF to loop indefinitely.
3. We create the first frame, this will act as the background. We use the green color table as LCT for this frame. We set a few attributes, such as the default color of the canvas, the length of the frame, and the color used for transparency. We draw a sequence of centered green squares, they will help see the transparency of the next frames.
4. Now, we create a sequence of frames, each of them being a smaller square located at an offset of the canvas. Since they have no LCT, they will use the GCT, and will thus be red. We draw a smaller square in their center with the transparent color, the background will show through this hole in the GIF.
5. Export the GIF to a file, and voilÃ , we're done!
